# Terraform Script to Deploy the Infrastructure

* To achieve the desired deployment process for the development components, including code push to GitHub, triggering a CodePipeline, building the code with CodeBuild, and pushing images to ECR using a CloudFormation template, you can follow these steps:

1 . Set up the necessary prerequisites:
* Ensure you have the AWS CLI and Terraform installed on your local machine.
* Create an AWS CodePipeline that listens to changes in your GitHub repository and triggers a CodeBuild project.

2 . Create a CloudFormation template (e.g., deployment.template.yaml) that defines the infrastructure resources for your development environment, including ECR repositories, IAM roles, security groups, etc. You can use the AWS CloudFormation YAML syntax to define the resources.

3 . Write a Terraform script (deployment.tf) to deploy the CloudFormation stack for each environment (dev, uat, qa, prod) using the CloudFormation template. The script should include the following steps:

    * Define Terraform variables for the environment-specific configurations.
    * Create an AWS CodePipeline resource that listens to changes in the GitHub repository.
    * Create an AWS CodeBuild project that builds the code and produces the necessary artifacts.
    * Create an IAM role for the CodeBuild project with appropriate permissions.
    * Create an AWS ECR repository to store the Docker images.
    * Create a CloudFormation stack using the aws_cloudformation_stack resource in Terraform, specifying the CloudFormation template and the required parameters.
    * Add a manual approval step in the CodePipeline before deploying the CloudFormation stack.

4 . Create a Terraform workspace for each environment (e.g., dev, uat, qa, prod) using the terraform workspace new <workspace_name> command.

5 . Define environment-specific values for the Terraform variables in the respective workspace using the terraform workspace select <workspace_name> and terraform workspace show commands.

6 . Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform project and download the required providers.

7 . Run terraform plan to review the changes Terraform will make to the infrastructure.

8 . Run terraform apply to deploy the infrastructure for the selected environment. You will be prompted for manual approval before deploying the CloudFormation stack.

9 . Repeat steps 4-8 for each environment.

    * By following these steps, you will have a Terraform script that deploys the infrastructure for each environment, triggers a CodePipeline for code deployment, and uses a CloudFormation template to push Docker images to ECR. The manual approval step in the CodePipeline ensures control over when the CloudFormation stack is deployed to each environment.
